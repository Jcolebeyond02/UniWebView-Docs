summary = """
`IUniWebViewAuthenticationFlow<TTokenType>` is an interface for implementing a custom authentication flow. 
An authentication flow, in UniWebView, usually a "code" based OAuth 2.0 flow, contains a standard set of steps:

1. User is navigated to a web page that requires authentication;
2. A temporary code is generated by service provider and provided to client by a redirect URL with customized scheme.
3. Client requests an access token using the temporary code by performing an "access token" exchange request.

To use the common flow, any customize authentication flow must implement this interface and becomes a subclass of
`UniWebViewAuthenticationCommonFlow`.

Returns the redirect URL that is used to redirect the user after authenticated. This is used as the `redirect_uri`

Usually this is a URL with customize scheme that later service provider may call. It takes intermediate code in its
query and can be used to open the current app in client. The native side of UniWebView will catch and handle it,
then send it to Unity side as the result of `UniWebViewAuthenticationSession`.
